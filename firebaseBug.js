The Firebase SDK's `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not trigger as expected in certain scenarios, particularly if the user's authentication state changes rapidly or if there are network interruptions.  This can lead to unexpected behavior in your application, such as a failure to update the UI to reflect the user's logged-in status or attempts to access features that require authentication failing silently.
