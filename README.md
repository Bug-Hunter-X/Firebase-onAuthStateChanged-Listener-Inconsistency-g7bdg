# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with the Firebase `onAuthStateChanged` listener where it might not reliably trigger when the user's authentication state changes quickly or network conditions are unstable. This can lead to unexpected application behavior.

## Bug Description:

The `onAuthStateChanged` listener is essential for managing user authentication state in Firebase applications.  However, under conditions of rapid authentication state changes (e.g., rapid sign-in/sign-out) or intermittent network connectivity, the listener may not fire as expected, resulting in UI elements not updating correctly or authentication checks failing silently.  This can lead to a degraded user experience and security vulnerabilities.

## Solution:

The provided solution attempts to address this by implementing debouncing techniques to reduce the frequency of listener calls during rapid changes.   It may also add more robust error handling and checking mechanisms.
