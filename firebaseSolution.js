This improved version of the code incorporates a debounce function to reduce the number of calls to the authentication state listener, preventing it from being overwhelmed and ensuring the UI reflects the correct state even with rapid authentication changes. 

```javascript
function debounce(func, wait) {
  let timeout;
  return function executedFunction(...args) {
    const later = () => {
      clearTimeout(timeout);
      func(...args);
    };
    clearTimeout(timeout);
    timeout = setTimeout(later, wait);
  };
}

firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged(debounce((user) => {
  if (user) {
    // User is signed in.
    console.log('User is signed in:', user);
    // Update UI accordingly.
  } else {
    // User is signed out.
    console.log('User is signed out');
    // Update UI accordingly.
  }
}, 200)); // Debounce interval set to 200 milliseconds
```
This helps to mitigate the unpredictable behavior of `onAuthStateChanged` in scenarios where events happen quickly.
